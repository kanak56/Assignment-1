                <span class="color-bamboo">Bamboo shoots</span> are considered as one of the useful health foods because
                of their rich contents of
                proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, fibres, and minerals and very low fat. Though bamboo shoots provide
                lots of health benefits, their consumption is confined mostly to Southeast Asian and East Asian
                countries.

            <h2>SEASONAL SALAD WITH BAMBOO</h2>
            <p>A simple salad is always a good way to enjoy fresh, local food. This salad had just a few
                ingredients, allowing the flavors of the sweet peas, kale raab, and bamboo shoots really stand
                out.

                curry features bell peppers, onions, and bamboo shoot but celery, carrots, and potatoes would
                also
